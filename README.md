## Python Skills

In this mini-project, I solved various Python exercises aimed at building and reinforcing fundamental Python skills. The tasks were performed within the SageMaker environment.

Task 1 - Missing Number Finder       
Task 2 - Unique Words Extractor    
Task 3 - Baby Names Data Extractor   
Task 4 - AWS S3 Integration  

This project demonstrates my ability to solve Python programming challenges, handle command-line arguments, work with external data sources, and integrate with cloud services like AWS S3 for data storage.
